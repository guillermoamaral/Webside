<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the project
This project was born as a motivation to learn React in particular and to improve my JavaScript skills in general.
Being a passionate smalltalker for more than 20 years now and having implemented several web APIs using it, I decided to expose Smalltalk itself thru a web API and see how far I could go implementing some of the Smalltalk IDE tools as a front-end of such API using React.
I used Bee Smalltalk as the back-end (porting the API to other Smalltalks later) and made the API evolve as I went progressing with the front-end tools, starting by the "static" side (code) and then moving to the "dynamic" side (objects).
At some point in the project I realized that the emphasis and effort should be put on keeping the API as simple as possible so as to make the port to other Smalltalks (relatively) easy.

Here's the some aspects I found intersting along the project:
* Having a simple API would ease its implementation in any Smalltalk falvor (Bee, Pharo, Squeak, Cuis, Dolphin) and get Webside for free.
* Far from being a downside, having a Smalltalk IDE implemented in JavaScript would enable contributions from the JavaScript community (much greater than the Smalltalk one) to either enhance, change or extend Webside in any direction.
* Not only this IDE could be used to work upon different Smalltalk images as its back-end but also it could allow several developers to work on the same Smalltalk instance (image) simulataneously, making Webside a collaborative environment.
